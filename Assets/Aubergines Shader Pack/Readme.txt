It does replace the original shader, so if you dont need this, just remove it from
your project.
Please check the demo scene to see how it works.
You must click PLAY at least once in order for effect to work.
Or, if it still doesnt work, restart unity so shaders can reload.

how it works.

HOW TO USE:
Look at demo scene and appropriate materials.
To use replacement shaders, just drag the appropriate script to your camera
and press space key to activate the effect.

HOW IT WORKS:

KNOWN ISSUES:
Lighting functions dont support lightmaps or deferred rendering at the moment.
Some lighting functions can/will be improved.
